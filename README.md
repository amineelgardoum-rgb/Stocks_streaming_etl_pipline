This project details the design and deployment of a **highly scalable, fault-tolerant data pipeline** engineered to ingest, process, and analyze real-time market data from **Finnhub**. The architecture leverages cloud-native principles, utilizing a decoupled streaming layer to ensure low-latency data availability for downstream analytics.

**Key achievements include:**

* Implementing a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** within **Snowflake** for strict data governance and quality assurance.
* Establishing reliable, scheduled data transformations using **dbt** and **Airflow**.
* Utilizing **Apache Kafka** to decouple the data ingestion from the processing logic, enabling massive horizontal scaling.

## ⚙️ Robustness and Scalability

This pipeline was specifically designed to handle high-volume streaming data with resilience:

* **Decoupling:** **Kafka** acts as a reliable buffer, allowing consumers to process data at their own pace and ensuring the system remains operational even during downstream outages.
* **Idempotency:** All **Airflow** tasks and **dbt** models are designed to be idempotent, allowing tasks to be safely re-run without creating duplicate or incorrect records, which is crucial for reliable failure recovery.
* **Layered Architecture:** The three-tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold) structure isolates raw, clean, and modeled data. This means any errors in the Gold layer can be traced back and accurately rebuilt from the immutable Bronze layer.
* **Cloud-Native Scale:** **Snowflake** provides instant, elastic compute resources, ensuring performance scales dynamically with data volume and query complexity.

## 🚀 Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
* Access and credentials for a **Snowflake** environment.
* Necessary **API keys** (e.g., Finnhub, stored securely in Airflow connections).

### Execution Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Clone the project repository
   git clone https://github.com/amineelgardoum-rgb/Stocks_streaming_etl_pipline.git
   cd stock-data-pipeline
   ```
2. **Service Initialization:**
   * Start all containerized services (**Kafka, Zookeeper, MinIO, Airflow**, etc.) using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     # Start all services in detached mode
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
3. **Configure Airflow:**
   * Access the **Airflow UI** (`http://localhost:8080`),you can login use admin in username and also admin in the password and configure connections for **Snowflake**, **MinIO**, and the **Finnhub** API key.
4. **Data Modeling:**
   * Verify **dbt** profiles are correctly configured to connect to **Snowflake**.
   * Run initial dbt seed files and tests.
5. **Run Pipeline:**
   * Unpause the main **Airflow DAG**  minio_to_snowflake to begin data flow from the minio (data lake) to snowflake(data warehouse).
   * Monitor stream health via **Kafdrop** (`http://localhost:9000` - *Assuming port 9000 for Kafdrop*) and task status via the Airflow UI.

## 🔭 Future Enhancements

* Integrating a visualization layer (e.g., Streamlit or Plotly Dash) for real-time dashboarding directly from the Gold layer.
* Implementing **Data Quality Checks (Great Expectations/dbt tests)** across all Silver and Gold models to enforce strict data integrity rules.
* Automating infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform** for full Infrastructure as Code (IaC) compliance.
